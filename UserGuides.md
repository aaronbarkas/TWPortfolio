# My Technical Writing Portfolio

> Hello everyone that views this portfolio.



This portfolio is written using the markdown markup (quite a mouthful) language and using the Docsify document site generator that scaffolds a static documentation site.

Docsify is available at:  [Docsify] (https://docsify.js.org/).

As I hope to keep this as a static sight with one page you can navigate the different writing and documentation that I have developed in a work place or in my own free time as a learning tool.
