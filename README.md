# My Technical Writing Portfolio

> Hello everyone that views this portfolio.



This portfolio is written using the markdown markup (quite a mouthful) language and using the Docsify document site generator that scaffolds a static documentation site.

Docsify is available at:  [Docsify] (https://docsify.js.org/).

As I hope to keep this as a static site with one page so you can navigate the different writing and documentation that I have developed in employment or in my own free time as a learning tool.

This portfolio is also a work in progress and will improve as my skills develop.
